Team Name: RubyCoders

Project Description:
1. Our system aims at providing admission application service to the users thereby allowing them to apply to a University. The application would allow the user to upload files, images and enter data.
2. Statistics related to location of applicants, location of previously admitted students (accompanied by Google Maps) would be displayed by our system.
3. Our system also aims to provide relevant information to supervisors, who review the application. The information required to evaluate a student should be available, hiding personal details of the student which the supervisor is not supposed to know.
4. We aim at achieving fault tolerance in case of system failure (e.g. if a server is down).
